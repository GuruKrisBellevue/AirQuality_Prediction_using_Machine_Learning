# AirQuality_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning
This Project explored the effects of air pollution and methods to combat it, focusing on the predictive capabilities offered by machine learning algorithms. A machine-learning model was built to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various environmental parameters and pollutant concentrations
